## Technical Implementation

### Data Source
- **Before**: Only used `checkedInBy` field (user ID)
- **After**: Uses `usherName` field (actual name), falls back to `checkedInBy` if needed

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Old data still works (falls back to `checkedInBy`)
- ✅ New data uses improved format automatically
- ✅ No migration needed

### Code Changes
- Updated `calculateAnalytics()` to use `usherName`
- Updated Excel export columns
- Updated PDF export columns
- Added new guest fields to interface
