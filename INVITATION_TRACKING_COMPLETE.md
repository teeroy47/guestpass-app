# Invitation Tracking System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
This document describes the complete invitation tracking system that prevents duplicate email sends and displays invitation status in the UI.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
Added two new fields to track invitation status:
- `invitation_sent` (boolean) - Whether an invitation has been sent
- `invitation_sent_at` (timestamp) - When the invitation was sent

**Files Updated:**
- `lib/supabase/types.ts` - Added fields to `SupabaseGuestRow` interface
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added `invitationSent` and `invitationSentAt` fields
- `lib/supabase/guest-service.ts` - Updated all queries and serialization

### 2. Backend Integration
The Express server now:
- Returns `sentGuestIds` array in the API response
- Tracks which specific guests received emails successfully
- Includes guest IDs in error tracking for failed sends

**Files Updated:**
- `server/index.mjs` - Enhanced `/api/send-invitations` endpoint

### 3. Frontend Features

#### A. Invitation Status Display
The guest table now shows invitation status with:
- **Badge**: "Sent" (with mail icon) or "Not sent"
- **Timestamp**: Date when invitation was sent
- **Column**: New "Invitation" column (hidden on small screens)

#### B. Duplicate Prevention
When sending invitations, the system:
1. **Filters** guests who already received invitations
2. **Warns** the user with a list of already-invited guests
3. **Asks** if they want to send only to uninvited guests
4. **Prevents** sending if all selected guests were already invited

#### C. Database Updates
After successful email sends:
1. Calls `SupabaseGuestService.markInvitationSent(guestIds)`
2. Updates the database with current timestamp
3. Refreshes the guest list to show updated status

**Files Updated:**
- `components/events/event-details-dialog.tsx` - Added UI and logic

## Database Migration Required

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: You need to add the new columns to your Supabase database.

### SQL Migration Script

Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add invitation tracking columns to guests table
ALTER TABLE guests 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS invitation_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS invitation_sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Add index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_guests_invitation_sent 
ON guests(invitation_sent);

-- Optional: Add comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN guests.invitation_sent IS 'Whether an email invitation has been sent to this guest';
COMMENT ON COLUMN guests.invitation_sent_at IS 'Timestamp when the invitation was sent';
```

## Environment Variables Fix

The server now properly loads environment variables from `.env.local`:

```javascript
// server/index.mjs
const envPath = join(__dirname, '..', '.env.local')
console.log('Loading environment from:', envPath)
dotenv.config({ path: envPath })

// Debug logging (without exposing sensitive data)
console.log('Environment variables loaded:')
console.log('- MAILERSEND_API_KEY:', process.env.MAILERSEND_API_KEY ? '✓ Set' : '✗ Not set')
console.log('- MAILERSEND_FROM_EMAIL:', process.env.MAILERSEND_FROM_EMAIL || '✗ Not set')
console.log('- MAILERSEND_FROM_NAME:', process.env.MAILERSEND_FROM_NAME || '✗ Not set')
console.log('- MAILERSEND_TEMPLATE_ID:', process.env.MAILERSEND_TEMPLATE_ID || '✗ Not set')
```

## How to Test

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute the SQL script above in Supabase SQL Editor.

### 2. Restart the Server
The server needs to be restarted to pick up the environment variable changes:

```powershell
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

### 3. Verify Environment Loading
Check the server console output. You should see:
```
Loading environment from: c:\Users\Teeroy\Downloads\guestpass-app\.env.local
Environment variables loaded:
- MAILERSEND_API_KEY: ✓ Set
- MAILERSEND_FROM_EMAIL: 1.test-r83ql3pk57xgzw1j.mlsender.net
- MAILERSEND_FROM_NAME: GuestPass Events|+263785211893
- MAILERSEND_TEMPLATE_ID: neqvygmedzd40p7w
```

### 4. Test Email Sending
1. Open an event with guests
2. Ensure at least one guest has an email address
3. Verify the recipient email in MailerSend dashboard (for test domain)
4. Click "Send Invitations" → "Send to All Guests"
5. Check the server console for any errors
6. Verify the invitation status updates in the UI

### 5. Test Duplicate Prevention
1. Try sending invitations to the same guests again
2. You should see a warning listing already-invited guests
3. Confirm to send only to uninvited guests
4. If all guests were already invited, you'll see "All guests already invited"

## UI Features

### Guest Table Columns
| Column | Description | Visibility |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Checkbox | Select for bulk actions | Admin only |
| Name | Guest name | Always |
| Email | Guest email | Hidden on mobile |
| Code | Unique QR code | Always |
| **Invitation** | **Invitation status** | **Hidden on small/medium screens** |
| Status | Check-in status | Always |
| Actions | Edit, delete, check-in | Always |

### Invitation Status Badge
- **Not sent**: Gray badge with "Not sent" text
- **Sent**: Outlined badge with mail icon and "Sent" text
  - Shows date below badge (e.g., "1/8/2025")

## API Response Format

The `/api/send-invitations` endpoint now returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": {
    "sent": 5,
    "failed": 0,
    "sentEmails": ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"],
    "sentGuestIds": ["guest-id-1", "guest-id-2"],
    "failedEmails": []
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### 1. "MailerSend API key is not configured"
**Cause**: Server hasn't loaded `.env.local` or was started before the fix.
**Solution**: Restart the server with `npm run dev`

#### 2. "Failed to update invitation status"
**Cause**: Database columns don't exist yet.
**Solution**: Run the SQL migration script in Supabase

#### 3. Invitation status not showing in UI
**Cause**: Database columns missing or guest data not refreshed.
**Solution**: 
- Run SQL migration
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors

## Code Architecture

### Service Layer
```typescript
// lib/supabase/guest-service.ts
class SupabaseGuestService {
  // Marks guests as invited with current timestamp
  static async markInvitationSent(guestIds: string[]): Promise<void>
  
  // Serializes database row to Guest object (includes invitation fields)
  private static serializeGuest(row: SupabaseGuestRow): Guest
}
```

### Component Logic
```typescript
// components/events/event-details-dialog.tsx
const handleSendInvitations = async (sendToAll: boolean) => {
  // 1. Filter guests with emails
  // 2. Separate already-invited from not-yet-invited
  // 3. Warn user about duplicates
  // 4. Send only to uninvited guests
  // 5. Update database with sent status
  // 6. Refresh guest list
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Resend Functionality**: Allow resending to specific guests
2. **Invitation History**: Track all invitation attempts
3. **Email Templates**: Multiple template options
4. **Batch Status**: Show "Sending..." progress for large batches
5. **Email Preview**: Preview email before sending
6. **Delivery Tracking**: Track email opens and clicks (MailerSend feature)

### Analytics
- Track invitation acceptance rate
- Monitor email delivery success rate
- Show invitation funnel (sent → opened → checked in)

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Loading Environment Variables
1. Check file path: `.env.local` should be in project root
2. Verify file contents (no syntax errors)
3. Restart server completely (stop and start, not just refresh)
4. Check server console for debug output

### Invitation Status Not Updating
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API response includes `sentGuestIds`
3. Check network tab for `/api/send-invitations` response
4. Ensure database columns exist
5. Verify Supabase connection

### Emails Not Sending
1. Check MailerSend API key is valid
2. Verify recipient email is verified (for test domain)
3. Check server console for detailed errors
4. Review MailerSend dashboard for delivery status
5. Ensure template ID is correct
