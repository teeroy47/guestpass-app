# Quick Fixes Summary

## 🎯 Three Issues Fixed

### 1. ⏰ Timestamp Issue - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Check-ins showing "1 day ago" when they just happened

**Solution:** Created `formatTimeAgo()` utility function with proper time calculations

**Result:** Now shows accurate timestamps like "5s ago", "2m ago", "1h ago"

---

### 2. 🧭 Navigation Issue - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** "Manage Guests" button opened a dialog instead of navigating to Guests tab

**Solution:** Added navigation callback, refactored button handler

**Result:** Button now navigates directly to Guests tab

---

### 3. 🔄 Page Reload Issue - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Entire page reloaded when guests were added/checked in

**Solution:** Created `refreshEventsSilently()` that updates data without loading state

**Result:** Smooth updates, no loading spinner, scroll position maintained
