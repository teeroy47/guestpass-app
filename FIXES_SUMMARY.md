# Fixes Summary - Bulk Actions & Email Confirmation

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Bulk Actions Selection Not Working
**Problem:** Clicking on event cards in bulk selection mode didn't select them.

**Root Cause:** The card's `onClick` handler was checking `!selectionMode` and doing nothing when in selection mode.

**Solution:** Created a new `handleCardClick` function that:
- In selection mode: Toggles selection when clicking anywhere on the card
- In normal mode: Opens the event details dialog
- Maintains checkbox functionality independently

**File Modified:** `components/events/event-list.tsx`

**Result:** ✅ Users can now click anywhere on an event card to select/deselect it in bulk actions mode

### ✅ 2. Localhost Redirect Issue
**Problem:** Email confirmation links were redirecting to `localhost:3000` instead of production URL.

**Root Cause:** Environment variable `APP_URL` wasn't accessible in the browser because Vite requires the `VITE_` prefix for client-side variables.

**Solution:** 
1. Renamed `APP_URL` → `VITE_APP_URL` in `.env.local`
2. Updated all references in `lib/auth-context.tsx` (3 locations)
3. Updated `.env.example` with proper documentation

**Files Modified:**
- `.env.local`
- `.env.example`
- `lib/auth-context.tsx`

**Result:** ✅ Email links now use production URL (`https://guestpass-app.vercel.app`)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** You must restart your dev server for this fix to work!

### ✅ 3. Missing Resend Confirmation Email Feature
**Problem:** Users had no way to resend confirmation emails if they didn't receive them or if links expired.

**Solution:** Implemented complete resend confirmation flow with:
- New resend function in auth context
- Dedicated resend confirmation page
- 60-second rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Real-time countdown timer
- Integration with login/signup flow
- Pre-filled email from URL parameters

**Files Created:**
- `components/auth/resend-confirmation.tsx` - Main resend page

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/auth-context.tsx` - Added `resendConfirmationEmail()` function
- `components/auth/login-form.tsx` - Added resend links
- `src/App.tsx` - Added `/resend-confirmation` route

**Features:**
- ✅ 60-second rate limiting (client-side)
- ✅ Real-time countdown timer
- ✅ Success state with clear instructions
- ✅ Email pre-population from signup
- ✅ Accessible from login page
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ User-friendly UI/UX

**Result:** ✅ Users can now resend confirmation emails with built-in spam protection

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying:
- [ ] Restart dev server (for env variable changes)
- [ ] Test bulk actions selection
- [ ] Test email redirect URLs
- [ ] Test resend confirmation flow
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works

### Vercel Configuration:
1. **Update Environment Variable:**
   - Change `APP_URL` → `VITE_APP_URL`
   - Value: `https://guestpass-app.vercel.app`

2. **Redeploy Application:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: bulk actions selection, email redirects, resend confirmation"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Supabase Configuration:
1. **Redirect URLs:** Ensure these are added:
   ```
   https://guestpass-app.vercel.app/auth/callback

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Dev Server Restart Required
The environment variable change (`APP_URL` → `VITE_APP_URL`) requires a dev server restart:
```bash
# Stop server: Ctrl+C
npm run dev
```

### ⚠️ Vercel Environment Variables
Don't forget to update the variable name in Vercel:
- Old: `APP_URL`
- New: `VITE_APP_URL`

### ⚠️ Rate Limiting
The 60-second rate limit is client-side (localStorage). Users can bypass it by:
- Clearing localStorage
- Using incognito mode
- Using different browsers

This is acceptable because:
- Supabase has server-side rate limits
- Client-side limit improves UX
- Reduces unnecessary API calls
- Prevents accidental spam
