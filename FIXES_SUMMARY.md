## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### QR Code Fix
```typescript
// Added state for QR codes
const [qrCodeSvgs, setQrCodeSvgs] = useState<Map<string, string>>(new Map())

// Generate QR codes asynchronously
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeTab === "qr-codes" && eventGuests.length > 0) {
    const generateQRCodes = async () => {
      const newQrCodes = new Map<string, string>()
      for (const guest of eventGuests.slice(0, 6)) {
        const qrData = generateQRCodeData(event.id, guest.uniqueCode)
        const qrSvg = await generateQRCodeSVG(qrData, 80)
        newQrCodes.set(guest.id, qrSvg)
      }
      setQrCodeSvgs(newQrCodes)
    }
    generateQRCodes()
  }
}, [activeTab, eventGuests, event.id])
```

### Analytics Integration
```typescript
// Analytics component now accepts eventId prop
<AnalyticsDashboard eventId={eventId} />

// Dashboard filters by event automatically
const filteredGuests = effectiveEventId === "all"
  ? guests
  : guests.filter(g => g.eventId === effectiveEventId)
```
