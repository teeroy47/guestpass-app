## 1. Phone Number Field in Guest Upload

### What Changed:
- Added `phone` field to the guests table in the database
- Updated CSV template to include phone number column
- Modified guest upload dialog to parse and display phone numbers
- Updated all backend services to support phone field

### Files Modified:
- `supabase-migration-phone-field.sql` (NEW)
- `components/guests/guest-upload-dialog.tsx`
- `lib/supabase/guest-service.ts`
- `lib/supabase/types.ts`

### CSV Format:
```csv
name,email,phone
John Smith,john@example.com,0785211893
Sarah Johnson,sarah@example.com,0712345678
```

### Database Migration Required:
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE guests 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS phone TEXT;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_guests_phone ON guests(phone);
```

## 2. Active Events with Real-Time Check-In Analytics

### What Changed:
- Replaced "Recent Events" section with "Active Events" section
- Implemented real-time Supabase subscriptions for live check-in updates
- Added toast notifications when guests check in from other devices
- Shows live analytics: checked-in count, pending count, attendance rate
- Displays recent check-ins with timestamps
- Auto-updates without page refresh

### Files Modified:
- `components/dashboard/active-events-realtime.tsx` (NEW)
- `components/dashboard/dashboard.tsx`

### Features:
- **Real-Time Updates**: When an usher scans a QR code, all dashboards update instantly
- **Live Notifications**: Pop-up notifications show "{Guest Name} has checked in"
- **Recent Check-Ins**: Shows last 5 check-ins with timestamps
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for each active event
- **Summary Stats**: Total checked-in across all active events

### How It Works:
1. Subscribes to Supabase `postgres_changes` on the `guests` table
2. Filters for UPDATE events where `checked_in` changes to `true`
3. Shows toast notification with guest name and event
4. Updates the UI in real-time without refresh
5. Auto-removes old notifications after 10 seconds

## 3. Prevent QR Code Generation for Completed Events

### What Changed:
- Added validation to disable QR code generation for completed events
- Completed events are shown as disabled in the event selector
- Warning message displayed when a completed event is selected
- QR code tabs are hidden for completed events

### Files Modified:
- `components/qr/qr-code-generator.tsx`

### User Experience:
- Completed events show: `Event Name (completed) - QR generation disabled`
- Warning banner: "⚠️ This event is marked as completed. QR code generation is disabled for completed events."
- QR code generation interface is completely hidden for completed events

---

## 4. Constrained Camera Feed in Scanner

### What Changed:
- Camera feed is now constrained to a 280x280px box in the center
- Video only shows within the scanning frame (not full screen)
- Added dark overlay around the scanning box for better focus
- Improved visual clarity and reduced distraction

### Files Modified:
- `components/scanner/qr-scanner.tsx`

### Technical Implementation:
- Scanner div constrained to 280x280px centered box
- Video element styled with `object-fit: cover` to fill the box
- Box shadow creates dark overlay around the scanning area
- Rounded corners for better aesthetics

### User Experience:
- Cleaner, more focused scanning interface
- Less distracting than full-screen camera feed
- Matches the size of typical QR codes
- Better performance on lower-end devices

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Phone Number Upload:
1. Go to event details → Overview tab → Click "Upload Guests"
2. Download the template CSV
3. Notice it now includes a `phone` column
4. Add guests with phone numbers in format: `0785211893`
5. Upload the CSV
6. Verify phone numbers appear in the preview

### 2. Test Real-Time Active Events:
1. Open the dashboard on two different devices/browsers
2. Mark an event as "Active"
3. On Device 1: Go to Scanner and scan a guest QR code
4. On Device 2: Watch the dashboard Overview tab
5. You should see:
   - Toast notification: "✅ Guest Checked In - {Name} has checked in to {Event}"
   - Recent check-ins section updates
   - Check-in count increases
   - Progress bar animates
   - All updates happen instantly without refresh

### 3. Test QR Code Prevention:
1. Go to QR Codes tab
2. Select an event dropdown
3. Mark an event as "Completed" (from Events tab)
4. Return to QR Codes tab
5. Try to select the completed event
6. Verify:
   - Event shows as disabled in dropdown
   - Warning message appears
   - QR code generation interface is hidden

### 4. Test Constrained Scanner:
1. Go to Scanner tab
2. Select an active event
3. Click "Start Scanning"
4. Verify:
   - Camera feed only shows in the center box (280x280px)
   - Dark overlay around the scanning area
   - Video doesn't fill the entire screen
   - Scanning still works perfectly

## Database Migration Steps

### Step 1: Run Phone Field Migration
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run the migration file: `supabase-migration-phone-field.sql`
4. Or manually run:
```sql
ALTER TABLE guests ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS phone TEXT;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_guests_phone ON guests(phone);
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration
```sql
-- Check if phone column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'guests' AND column_name = 'phone';
```

---

## Breaking Changes

### None! 
All changes are backward compatible:
- Phone field is optional (can be NULL)
- Existing guests without phone numbers will continue to work
- Old CSV files without phone column will still upload successfully
- All existing features continue to work as before

---

## Performance Considerations

### Real-Time Subscriptions:
- Supabase real-time subscriptions are efficient and scalable
- Only subscribes when dashboard is open
- Automatically unsubscribes when component unmounts
- Filters only for active events to reduce unnecessary updates

### Scanner Optimization:
- Constrained video feed reduces rendering overhead
- Better performance on mobile devices
- Lower memory usage compared to full-screen video

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Phone Number Validation**: Add format validation for phone numbers
2. **SMS Notifications**: Send check-in confirmations via SMS
3. **WhatsApp Integration**: Send QR codes via WhatsApp using phone numbers
4. **Phone Number Search**: Search guests by phone number
5. **Bulk SMS**: Send event reminders to all guests via SMS
6. **International Format**: Support international phone number formats

---

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database migration was successful
3. Ensure Supabase real-time is enabled in your project
4. Check camera permissions for scanner
5. Verify event status is set correctly
