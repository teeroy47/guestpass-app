# Completed Events - Read-Only Mode

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of read-only mode for completed events in the GuestPass application.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Event Details Dialog Component** (`components/events/event-details-dialog.tsx`)

#### New State Variables
- `isEventCompleted`: Boolean flag that checks if event status is "completed"
- `isReadOnly`: Combined flag that checks if user is in read-only mode OR event is completed

#### Disabled Features for Completed Events

##### Event Editing
- ✅ **Edit button** is disabled when event is completed
- ✅ **Status badge** shows "Completed - Read Only" for completed events
- ✅ Event details (title, description, venue, start time) cannot be modified

##### Guest Management
- ✅ **Add Guest** button is hidden for completed events
- ✅ **Guest form inputs** (name, email) are hidden for completed events
- ✅ **Edit guest** button is hidden for completed events
- ✅ **Delete guest** button is hidden for completed events
- ✅ **Check-in toggle** button is hidden for completed events
- ✅ **Guest selection checkboxes** are hidden for completed events

##### Bulk Actions
- ✅ **Upload Guests** button is hidden for completed events
- ✅ **Send Invitations** button is hidden for completed events
- ✅ **Send to Selected** button is hidden for completed events

##### User Interface
- ✅ **Alert message** displayed at top of Overview tab explaining read-only mode
- ✅ **"Read only" text** shown in Actions column of guest table for completed events
- ✅ **Badge indicator** in dialog header showing "Completed - Read Only"

#### Features Still Available for Completed Events

##### View-Only Features
- ✅ View all event details
- ✅ View guest list
- ✅ Search and filter guests
- ✅ View analytics dashboard
- ✅ Export data to Excel
- ✅ Export data to PDF

## User Experience

### For Admin Users
When an admin opens a completed event:
1. A clear alert message appears at the top of the Overview tab
2. The Edit button is disabled (grayed out)
3. A "Completed - Read Only" badge is displayed in the header
4. All guest management controls are hidden
5. Only viewing and exporting features remain available

### For Usher Users
Usher users already have limited permissions, but completed events add an additional layer of protection ensuring no modifications can be made.

## Technical Implementation

### Code Structure
```typescript
// Check if event is completed
const isEventCompleted = event?.status === "completed"

// Combine with existing read-only checks
const isReadOnly = isReadOnlyAdminView || isEventCompleted

// Conditionally render controls
{showAdminControls && !isEventCompleted && (
  // Guest management controls
)}
```

### Conditional Rendering Pattern
All modification controls use the pattern:
```typescript
{showAdminControls && !isEventCompleted && (
  <Button>Modify Action</Button>
)}
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental modifications to historical event data
2. **Audit Trail**: Ensures completed events remain unchanged for reporting
3. **User Safety**: Clear visual indicators prevent confusion
4. **Compliance**: Maintains accurate records for completed events
5. **Flexibility**: Admins can still export and view all data

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases
1. ✅ Create a new event with status "active"
2. ✅ Add guests to the event
3. ✅ Change event status to "completed"
4. ✅ Verify Edit button is disabled
5. ✅ Verify guest management controls are hidden
6. ✅ Verify alert message is displayed
7. ✅ Verify export functions still work
8. ✅ Verify analytics tab still displays data
9. ✅ Change event back to "active" (if needed for testing)
10. ✅ Verify all controls are re-enabled

### Edge Cases
- Event with no guests (completed)
- Event with 100+ guests (completed)
- Switching between active and completed status
- Multiple users viewing same completed event

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Add a "Reopen Event" feature for admins to change status back to active
2. Add audit log showing when event was marked as completed
3. Add confirmation dialog when marking event as completed
4. Add bulk status change for multiple events
5. Add "Archive" status separate from "Completed"
