# ðŸ”§ API URL Fix Applied

## Problem
The deployed app was trying to connect to `http://localhost:4000/api/generate-bundle` for PDF/ZIP downloads, which caused a **connection refused** error in production.

## Root Cause
The API URL was hardcoded to `localhost:4000` in the QR code generator component.

## Solution Applied âœ…

### 1. Updated API Calls (components/qr/qr-code-generator.tsx)
Changed from:
```javascript
fetch("http://localhost:4000/api/generate-bundle", ...)
```

To:
```javascript
fetch("/api/generate-bundle", ...)
```

This makes the API calls **relative**, so they work in both:
- **Development**: `http://localhost:5173/api/generate-bundle` â†’ proxied to `http://localhost:4000`
- **Production**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/generate-bundle` â†’ routed to serverless function

### 2. Added Vite Proxy Configuration (vite.config.ts)
Added proxy to forward `/api` requests to the backend server during development:
```typescript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:4000',
      changeOrigin: true,
    },
  },
}
```

### 3. Rebuilt the Application
âœ… Build completed successfully
âœ… All 3235 modules transformed
âœ… Ready for deployment

## Next Step: Redeploy ðŸš€

Run this command to deploy the fix:

```powershell
vercel --prod
```

## What This Fixes
âœ… PDF bundle downloads will now work in production
âœ… ZIP bundle downloads will now work in production
âœ… API calls will use the correct domain automatically
âœ… Development environment still works with local backend

## How It Works

### In Development:
1. Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`
2. Backend runs on `http://localhost:4000`
3. Vite proxy forwards `/api/*` requests to backend
4. Everything works seamlessly

### In Production (Vercel):
1. Frontend is served as static files from `/dist`
2. Backend runs as serverless function at `/api/*`
3. `vercel.json` routes `/api/*` to `server/index.mjs`
4. Relative URLs automatically use the production domain

## Files Modified
- âœ… `components/qr/qr-code-generator.tsx` (lines 102, 142)
- âœ… `vite.config.ts` (added proxy configuration)
