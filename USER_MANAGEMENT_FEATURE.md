# User Management Feature

## Overview

This feature allows the super administrator (`chiunyet@africau.edu`) to promote other users to admin role or demote them back to usher role directly from the web application. Role changes take effect immediately in both the frontend and backend.

## Features

### ✅ Super Admin Privileges
- Only `chiunyet@africau.edu` can access the user management interface
- Only the super admin can change user roles
- The super admin's own role cannot be changed (protected)

### ✅ User Management Interface
- View all registered users in a table
- See user details: email, display name, role, join date
- Promote users from "usher" to "admin"
- Demote users from "admin" to "usher"
- Confirmation dialog before role changes
- Real-time updates after role changes

### ✅ Role-Based Access Control
**Admin Role:**
- Full access to all features
- Create/edit/delete events
- Upload guest lists
- View analytics
- Scan QR codes
- Check in guests

**Usher Role:**
- Limited access
- View events and guests
- Scan QR codes
- Check in guests
- Cannot create/edit events
- Cannot upload guest lists
- Cannot view analytics

### ✅ Immediate Effect
- Role changes are saved to the database immediately
- Users see updated permissions on next page refresh
- No need to log out and log back in
- Role is fetched from database on every session

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

1. **`components/admin/user-management.tsx`**
   - User management interface component
   - Table showing all users
   - Promote/demote buttons
   - Confirmation dialogs
   - Access control (super admin only)

2. **`app/api/admin/update-user-role/route.ts`**
   - API endpoint to update user roles
   - Validates super admin access
   - Prevents changing super admin's role
   - Updates database with new role

### Files Modified

1. **`components/dashboard/dashboard.tsx`**
   - Added "Users" tab (visible only to super admin)
   - Imported UserManagement component
   - Added `isSuperAdmin` check
   - Updated role detection to use database role

2. **`lib/auth-context.tsx`**
   - Added `userRole` state
   - Added `userRole` to context interface
   - Modified `fetchDisplayName` to also fetch role
   - Modified `ensureUserProfile` to check database for existing role
   - Updated role to be fetched from database on login
   - Clear role on sign out

## How It Works

### Role Assignment Flow

1. **New User Registration:**
   - User signs up with email and password
   - If email is `chiunyet@africau.edu` → gets "admin" role
   - All other users → get "usher" role by default
   - Role is saved to database

2. **Existing User Login:**
   - User logs in
   - System checks database for user's current role
   - Role is loaded from database (not hardcoded)
   - User sees interface based on their current role

3. **Role Change by Super Admin:**
   - Super admin opens "Users" tab
   - Clicks "Promote to Admin" or "Demote to Usher"
   - Confirms the change in dialog
   - API updates role in database
   - User's role is updated immediately
   - User sees new permissions on next page load

### Database Schema

The `users` table includes:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  full_name TEXT,
  display_name TEXT,
  role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'usher', -- 'admin' or 'usher'
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/admin/update-user-role`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "userId": "uuid-of-user",
  "role": "admin" | "usher"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User role updated to admin",
  "userId": "uuid-of-user",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `401 Unauthorized` - Not logged in
- `403 Forbidden` - Not super admin or trying to change super admin's role
- `404 Not Found` - User not found
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid input

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Super Admin Access
- [ ] Log in as `chiunyet@africau.edu`
- [ ] Verify "Users" tab is visible
- [ ] Open Users tab and see all users
- [ ] Verify super admin badge shows on own account

### ✅ Role Changes
- [ ] Promote a usher to admin
- [ ] Verify confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Confirm the change
- [ ] Verify success message
- [ ] Check user's role updated in table
- [ ] Log in as that user and verify admin access
- [ ] Demote the admin back to usher
- [ ] Verify usher has limited access

### ✅ Access Control
- [ ] Log in as a non-super admin
- [ ] Verify "Users" tab is NOT visible
- [ ] Try to access `/api/admin/update-user-role` directly
- [ ] Verify 403 Forbidden error

### ✅ Protected Super Admin
- [ ] Try to change super admin's role via API
- [ ] Verify error message
- [ ] Verify super admin role unchanged

### ✅ Immediate Effect
- [ ] Change a user's role
- [ ] Have that user refresh their page
- [ ] Verify they see updated permissions immediately
- [ ] No logout required

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Users" tab not visible
**Solution:** Only `chiunyet@africau.edu` can see this tab. Log in with the super admin account.

### Issue: Role change doesn't take effect
**Solution:** 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API call succeeded
3. Have user refresh the page
4. Check database to confirm role was updated

### Issue: "Access Denied" message
**Solution:** This feature is restricted to the super administrator only. Contact `chiunyet@africau.edu` if you need role changes.

### Issue: Can't change super admin's role
**Solution:** This is by design. The super admin's role is protected and cannot be changed to ensure system security.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- [ ] Role change history/audit log
- [ ] Bulk role changes
- [ ] Custom roles with granular permissions
- [ ] Email notifications on role changes
- [ ] User search and filtering
- [ ] Export user list
- [ ] User activity tracking
- [ ] Temporary role assignments

## Technical Notes

### Why Database Role Takes Precedence
The system checks the database for the user's role on every login. This ensures:
1. Role changes take effect immediately
2. No need to update Supabase Auth metadata
3. Simpler implementation
4. More reliable and consistent

### Role Sync Strategy
```typescript
// On login, check database first
const existingUser = await supabase
  .from("users")
  .select("role")
  .eq("id", userId)
  .single()

if (existingUser) {
  // Use role from database
  role = existingUser.role
} else {
  // New user - assign default role
  role = email === "chiunyet@africau.edu" ? "admin" : "usher"
}
```

### Context Integration
The `userRole` is stored in the auth context and updated whenever:
- User logs in
- User's profile is fetched
- User signs out (cleared)

This ensures the role is always available throughout the app without additional database queries.
