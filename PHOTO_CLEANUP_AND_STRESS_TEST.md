# 🔥 Photo Cleanup & Stress Test Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

This document summarizes the automatic photo cleanup feature and comprehensive stress testing suite implemented to ensure system scalability and storage safety.

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

### **Critical Issue: Storage Leak**
When events were deleted, guest records were removed from the database (via CASCADE), but **photo files remained in Supabase Storage forever**, causing:
- ❌ Orphaned files accumulating indefinitely
- ❌ Storage filling up with unused photos
- ❌ No way to reclaim space
- ❌ Potential service disruption when storage full

### **Scalability Concern**
With 10 concurrent ushers checking in guests with photos:
- 600 check-ins per event = ~210 MB storage
- Without cleanup: Storage full after 5-6 events
- Risk of hitting 1GB free tier limit quickly

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Automatic Photo Cleanup

### **Implementation**
Modified `EventService.deleteEvent()` in `lib/supabase/event-service.ts` to:

1. **Fetch all guest photo URLs** for the event before deletion
2. **Extract file paths** from full Supabase URLs
3. **Delete photos from storage** using `storage.remove()`
4. **Delete the event** (CASCADE handles guest records)

### **Code Changes**

**File:** `lib/supabase/event-service.ts`

```typescript
static async deleteEvent(id: string) {
  const client = await this.getClient()
  
  // Step 1: Fetch all guest photo URLs for this event before deletion
  const { data: guests, error: fetchError } = await client
    .from("guests")
    .select("photo_url")
    .eq("event_id", id)
    .not("photo_url", "is", null)

  if (fetchError) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch guest photos for cleanup:", fetchError)
    // Continue with deletion even if photo fetch fails
  }

  // Step 2: Delete photos from storage
  if (guests && guests.length > 0) {
    const photoUrls = guests
      .map((guest) => guest.photo_url)
      .filter((url): url is string => url !== null)

    if (photoUrls.length > 0) {
      // Extract file paths from full URLs
      const filePaths = photoUrls.map((url) => {
        const match = url.match(/\/guestpass\/(.+)$/)
        return match ? match[1] : null
      }).filter((path): path is string => path !== null)

      if (filePaths.length > 0) {
        const { error: storageError } = await client.storage
          .from("guestpass")
          .remove(filePaths)

        if (storageError) {
          console.error("Failed to delete photos from storage:", storageError)
          // Continue with event deletion even if storage cleanup fails
        } else {
          console.log(`✅ Deleted ${filePaths.length} photo(s) from storage for event ${id}`)
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Step 3: Delete the event (CASCADE will delete guest records)
  const { error } = await client.from("events").delete().eq("id", id)

  if (error) {
    throw error
  }
}
```

### **How It Works**

1. **Before deletion:** Query all guests for the event and get their `photo_url` values
2. **Extract paths:** Parse full URLs to get storage file paths
   - URL: `https://project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/guestpass/guest-photos/event-123/photo.jpg`
   - Path: `guest-photos/event-123/photo.jpg`
3. **Delete from storage:** Use `storage.remove()` to delete all photos in one batch
4. **Delete event:** Normal event deletion proceeds (CASCADE deletes guest records)

### **Error Handling**

- ✅ **Graceful degradation:** If photo fetch fails, event deletion still proceeds
- ✅ **Logging:** All operations logged for debugging
- ✅ **Batch deletion:** All photos deleted in single API call for efficiency
- ✅ **Null safety:** Handles missing or null photo URLs

### **Benefits**

- ✅ **Automatic:** No manual intervention needed
- ✅ **Reliable:** Works every time an event is deleted
- ✅ **Efficient:** Batch deletion minimizes API calls
- ✅ **Safe:** Doesn't break if storage cleanup fails
- ✅ **Scalable:** Handles events with hundreds of photos

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### **Expected Results (Good System Health)**

```
✅ Success Rate: >98%
✅ Average Response Time: 1,500 - 2,500ms

```

### **Test Scenario: 10 Concurrent Ushers**

**Configuration:**
- 10 ushers × 60 guests = 600 check-ins
- 600 photos × 350KB = ~210 MB storage
- Duration: ~10-15 minutes

**Expected Metrics:**
- Total check-ins: 600
- Successful: >590 (>98%)
- Average response: <3 seconds
- Storage used: ~210 MB
- Photos cleaned up: 100%

## 🎯 Scalability Analysis

### **With Cleanup Implemented ✅**

```
Scenario: 8 events/month, 10 ushers each
Storage per event: 210 MB
Active events: 3-5 at a time
Total storage: 600MB - 1GB
Orphaned files: 0
Monthly cost: $0 (within free tier)
Risk level: LOW ✅
```

### **Without Cleanup ❌**

```
Scenario: Same usage
Storage per event: 210 MB
After 5-6 events: 1GB limit reached
Orphaned files: Growing indefinitely
Monthly cost: $5-15 (overage charges)
Risk level: HIGH ❌
Service disruption: LIKELY ❌
```

## 🚀 How to Run Stress Tests

### **Step 1: Initial Storage Check**
```bash
npm run stress-test:storage
```

Review current storage usage and establish baseline.

### **Step 2: Run Full Stress Test**
```bash
npm run stress-test
```

This will:
1. Create a test event
2. Simulate 10 ushers checking in 600 guests
3. Upload 600 photos (~210 MB)
4. Measure all performance metrics
5. Delete the event and verify cleanup
6. Generate comprehensive report

### **Step 3: Review Results**

Check the console output for:
- ✅ Success rate (should be >95%)
- ✅ Response times (should be <3s average)
- ✅ Storage usage (should match expected)
- ✅ Photo cleanup (should be 100%)

### **Step 4: Clean Up (If Needed)**
```bash
# Preview orphaned files
npm run stress-test:cleanup

# Actually delete them
npm run stress-test:cleanup --confirm
```

## 📈 Monitoring in Production

### **Before Major Events**
```bash
# Check storage health
npm run stress-test:storage

# Run quick performance test
npm run stress-test:quick
```

### **During Events**
```bash
# Monitor in real-time (checks every 30s)
npm run stress-test:monitor 30
```

### **After Events**
```bash
# Verify cleanup worked
npm run stress-test:storage

# Clean up any orphaned files
npm run stress-test:cleanup --confirm
```

### **Monthly Maintenance**
```bash
# Full storage audit
npm run stress-test:storage

# Clean up orphaned files
npm run stress-test:cleanup --confirm
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Photos Not Cleaning Up**

**Symptoms:**
- Orphaned files accumulating
- Storage usage not decreasing after event deletion

**Solutions:**
1. Check console logs during event deletion
2. Verify storage policies allow deletion
3. Check file path extraction logic
4. Manually run cleanup: `npm run stress-test:cleanup --confirm`

### **Issue: Low Success Rate in Tests**

**Symptoms:**
- <95% success rate
- Many failed check-ins

**Solutions:**
1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify storage policies are correct
3. Check database connection limits
4. Review network connectivity
5. Check for rate limiting

### **Issue: Slow Response Times**

**Symptoms:**
- Average >4s response time
- Poor user experience

**Solutions:**
1. Check network latency to Supabase
2. Review image compression settings
3. Check database indexes
4. Monitor Supabase dashboard
5. Consider reducing photo resolution

### **Issue: Storage Full**

**Symptoms:**
- "Storage limit exceeded" errors
- Upload failures

**Solutions:**
1. Run cleanup immediately: `npm run stress-test:cleanup --confirm`
2. Delete old events with photos
3. Check for orphaned files
4. Consider upgrading Supabase plan
5. Reduce photo resolution (1200px → 1000px)
