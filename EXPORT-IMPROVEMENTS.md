# Event Export Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ "Checked By" Field Now Shows Usher Name
**Before**: The "Checked By" column showed the user ID (`checkedInBy` field)
**After**: The "Checked By" column now shows the actual usher name (`usherName` field)

**Implementation**:
- Updated Excel export to use `guest.usherName || guest.checkedInBy || ''`
- Updated PDF export to use `guest.usherName || guest.checkedInBy || ''`
- Falls back to `checkedInBy` if `usherName` is not available (for backward compatibility)

### 2. ✅ Usher Performance Statistics Now Use Real Usher Names
**Before**: Usher statistics were based on user IDs from `checkedInBy` field
**After**: Usher statistics now use actual usher names from `usherName` field

**Implementation**:
- Updated `calculateAnalytics()` function to use `guest.usherName` instead of `guest.checkedInBy`
- This provides accurate, human-readable usher performance metrics

### 3. ✅ Added Guest Details to Export
**New Fields Added to Guest List**:
- **Phone**: Guest phone number
- **Seating Area**: Reserved or Free Seating
- **Cuisine Choice**: Traditional or Western

**Implementation**:
- Updated Guest interface in export-utils.ts to include all guest fields
- Added columns to Excel export: Phone, Seating Area, Cuisine Choice
- Added columns to PDF export: Seating, Cuisine

## Data Flow

### How Usher Information is Captured

1. **Scanner Session Start**:
   - When an usher starts scanning, a scanner session is created
   - Session includes: `usherName`, `usherEmail`, `eventId`

2. **Guest Check-in**:
   - When a QR code is scanned, the guest is checked in
   - Guest record is updated with:
     - `checkedIn: true`
     - `checkedInAt: timestamp`
     - `checkedInBy: user_id` (for authentication/audit)
     - `usherName: "Actual Usher Name"` (for display/reporting)
     - `usherEmail: "usher@example.com"` (for contact)

3. **Export**:
   - Export reads `usherName` field for display
   - Falls back to `checkedInBy` if `usherName` is not available
   - Usher statistics are calculated from `usherName` field

## Benefits

### 1. Human-Readable Reports
- Exports now show actual names like "John Doe" instead of user IDs like "auth0|123456"
- Makes reports immediately useful without needing to look up user IDs

### 2. Accurate Usher Performance Tracking
- Usher Performance table shows real statistics
- Can identify which ushers checked in the most guests
- Useful for event management and performance evaluation

### 3. Complete Guest Information
- All guest details from registration are now included in exports
- Seating area and cuisine choice help with event planning
- Phone numbers available for contact if needed

### 4. Better Event Analytics
- Can analyze check-in patterns by usher
- Can correlate usher performance with time of day
- Can identify peak check-in times and staffing needs
