      channel.subscribe()
    }, 3000)

## Performance Considerations

### Photo Resolution Increase

- **Benefit**: Much better image quality and detail
- **Mitigation**: Still compressed and optimized for web delivery

### Real-time Connection
- **Impact**: More robust connection handling
- **Benefit**: Fewer missed updates, better reliability
- **Mitigation**: Automatic reconnection prevents manual intervention

### Bulk Delete
- **Impact**: Parallel deletion of multiple events
- **Benefit**: Faster cleanup of old events
- **Mitigation**: Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Progressive Image Loading**: Show low-res preview while high-res loads
2. **Batch Photo Upload**: Upload multiple photos at once
3. **Export Selected Events**: Export data for selected events
4. **Duplicate Event**: Clone event settings
